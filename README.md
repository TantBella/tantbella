## Creative software dev fueled by tea, curiosity and sometimes a playlist with nostalgic music from the 90's and 00’s...

### About me:  
Most days you'll find me deep in code, whether it’s in JavaScript, .NET or whatever new technology I’m currently obsessed with. My favorite types of projects are the ones where I get to combine logic, design and a bit of personality.  
Right now, I’m diving deep into DevOps and exploring how to automate, streamline and optimize the software lifecycle, turning ideas into smooth-running realities.  

When I’m not coding, I’m probably re-potting plants, pair programming with my kids (because why not start them early?) or coming up with weird app ideas.

### Let’s connect if you:
- Like tea (or coffee, I won’t judge)
- Want to talk code, design, or houseplant pest control (yes, I know way too much about that)  
- Enjoy discussing which sitcom is the GOAT (it's obviously The Office) or why there aren’t more seasons of Ghosts? Or maybe dissect the latest chaos on RHOBH or MAFS? (Yes, please.)  
- Believe that great work happens where empathy, curiosity and sarcasm meet
